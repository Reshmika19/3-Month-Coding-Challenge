# 3-Month-Coding-Challenge

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my 3-month coding challenge!
Starting October 1st, I am committed to solving the most frequently asked coding problems, especially those that are useful for technical interviews. Over the course of 3 months, I will focus on Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem-Solving with a special focus on array-based problems, followed by other critical topics in November and December.

ðŸ”¥ Why This Challenge?
The goal is to build consistency and solve coding problems that will prepare me for placement interviews, covering a wide range of frequently asked problems in top tech companies.

ðŸ—“ Challenge Timeline:
October 2024: Focus on Array-based problems.
November 2024: Move to more advanced topics like Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees, and Greedy Algorithms.
December 2024: Work on System Design and tackle Mock Interview Questions.

ðŸš€ Challenge Guidelines:
Daily Coding: Solve at least one coding problem per day and upload the solution to this repository.
Readme Updates: Keep this README.md updated with the problem description and a brief explanation of my approach.
Programming Language: Most problems will be solved using Java.
GitHub Repository: The code for each problem will be organized by topic and date to make it easy to follow along.

ðŸ§° Tools & Resources:
LeetCode / GeeksForGeeks for problems.
Java for implementing the solutions.
GitHub to track and share progress.

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Š
